	   				Air travel and shipping has become a staple industry of today's global economy. In 2016 alone, approximately 3.6 billion passengers flew on regularly scheduled flights around the world, and more than 100,000 planes take to the skies each and every day.
	   			</p>
	   			<p>
	   				However, despite how many planes fly every day, planes do crash and make hard landings from time to time. The goal of this visualization is to take a look at the characteristics of reported incidents dated from 1995 to mid-2016, which were retrieved from the National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) website.

	   			<h1 class='lead'>Which aircraft have the most incidents?</h1>
	   			<p>
	   				Thousands of planes take off and land in cities around the world each day. In reported incidents in aircraft, it is estimated that approximately 80% of flight incidents are explained by pilot error, with only the other 20% being accounted for by weather and equipment issues.
	   			</p>
	   			<p>
	   				Clearly, some models of plane are more popular than others. However, some planes may be more prone to incidents that leave the aircraft destroyed in the event of an incident. This could be due to pilot training issues in some localities and by some airlines, or by abnormal flight characteristics, as we saw this year with the new 737 MAX series.

	   				Hover over the bars below to see additional information about each plane model.

	   			<h1 class='lead'>Are planes getting safer?</h1>
	   			<p>
	   				With reduced reliance on pilots to fly planes, thus decreasing the chance of pilot error, it would seem apparent that flying is getting safer each and every year. But is it? In this section, let's take a look at the number of recorded incidents that left an airframe substantially damaged or destroyed.

	   		<section class='story'>
	   			<h1 class='lead'>What about weather?</h1>
	   			<p>
	   				Frequent fliers are familiar with turbulence on long flights over large storm systems. For those with weak stomachs, a turbluent trip could inspire feelings of doom. However, is it actually any less safe to fly in bad weather with today's airplanes and flight technology?
	   			</p>
	   			<p>
	   				In this section, we compare the data of incident events during visual meteorological conditions (VMC), or flights in weather with good visibility, versus events during instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which are flights that require pilots to utilize flight instruments to navigate in areas of poor visibility. Some cases did not have weather conditions recorded, so for this section, those cases will be excluded.
	   			</p>
	   			<p>
	   				In addition, severe weather conditions often cause the most issues during the critical phases of flight, being takeoff and landing. Let's look at how weather conditions affect the critical phases of flight. Hover over the below donut charts to see which phases of flight are most incident-inducing for both VMC and IMC.

	   			<h1 class='lead'>Conclusion</h1>
	   			<p>
	   				Air travel continues to be one of the safest options for travel, and air industries will only continue to grow. As pilot error continues to be the leading cause for air travel incidents, it will be interesting in future years to see how autonomy and AI fit into the cockpit.
